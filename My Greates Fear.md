1. # My greatest fear
2. I have a big fear of spiders. These are some extremely intelligent insects. There are spiders that create decoys of themselves to trick other creatures. They are fake spider makers. Spiders that spin funnel webs exist, some spiders move around by creating web parachutes. So who's to say that they won't use it to obliterate entire humans?
